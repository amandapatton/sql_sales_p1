# SQL Project 1 - Sales Analysis

This project showcases my SQL skills by analyzing a synthetic retail sales dataset in **Google BigQuery**. The dataset simulates e-commerce sales from 2022 and 2023 and includes detailed transaction data such as customer demographics, product categories, sale amounts, and cost of goods sold (COGS).

The project includes **data cleaning**, **exploratory analysis**, and **business question-solving**, with a focus on **profitability**, **customer segmentation**, and **year-over-year trends**.

## üéØ Skills Demonstrated

- Data cleaning with `DELETE`, `ALTER TABLE`, and `RENAME COLUMN`
- Aggregation with `SUM`, `COUNT`, `AVG`, and `GROUP BY`
- Conditional logic using `CASE WHEN`
- Window functions like `RANK()`
- String formatting for business-friendly outputs using `FORMAT`, `CONCAT`, and `CAST`
- CTEs for modular, readable queries

## üìä Dataset Overview

- **Table name**: `sql_sales_project1.sales1`
- **Timeframe**: 2022‚Äì2023
- **Columns**:
  - `transactions_id`: Transaction unique ID
  - `sale_date` / `sale_time`: Timestamp of sale
  - `customer_id`, `gender`, `age`: Customer information
  - `category`: Product category
  - `quantity`, `price_per_unit`, `cogs`, `total_sale`: Sales metrics

## Schema
```
    CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS sql_sales_project1.sales1
      (
        transactions_id INT64,
        sale_date DATE,
        sale_time TIME,
        customer_id INT64,
        gender STRING,
        age INT64,
        category STRING,
        quantiy INT64,
        price_per_unit FLOAT64,
        cogs FLOAT64,
        total_sale FLOAT64,
        PRIMARY KEY (transactions_id) NOT ENFORCED)
```
### Note:  Column "quantiy" is misspelled. This is addressed as a data cleaning step below.

---

## üßπ Data Cleaning Steps

- Checked for and removed rows with `NULL` values
- Fixed a misspelled column (`quantiy` ‚Üí `quantity`)
  ```
    ALTER TABLE `sql_sales_project1.sales1`
    RENAME COLUMN quantiy TO quantity
  ```
- Verified row count and schema integrity
